# unhelpful-bot
The Unhelpful Bot is a chatbot that shows unhelpful responses of real bots used by companies

This chatbot Bot is based on real responses used by companies to try to evade their customers and provide horrible customer support
This is an example of how NOT to write a bot.

Everybody is welcome to contribute.

If you want to add responses to the bot just contact me, and I add it.
The only condition is that the responses come from real chatbots used by companies or governments
